<h2>About me</h2>
  <p> I am a triplet living in Brooklyn, NY studying Computer Information Systems at Baruch College. In 2015 I chose to challenge myself
    and relocate to New York on my own. With this change at such an early age, I not only learned a lot about myself as an individual but
    I had the opportunity to follow my passion for photography. If I had known my passion for photography would land my first job 
    at an Apple retail store as a technician, I would have started earlier. While working in the Apple of World Trade Center, I quickly 
    found my interest for leading teams, solving complex technical problems as well as the technology industry. I chose to step out of my 
    comfort zone and experience other challenges, which encouraged me to apply to Google in 2017. With the achievement of passing the Google
    interviews, I knew that the technology industry was for me. After spending a 3 month internship in the Google NYC office, I was even more 
    hungry for challenging projects. With that being said, I took the initiative to get my hands dirty by joining multiple startups with their work. 
    To this day I have held a leadership role at Apple, two internships at Google and worked in a few self-starting startups to learn what it takes 
    to become the best person that I can be. </p>

  Our goal at Litterly is to encourage users to clean up the world one piece of trash at a time. 
  
  <p>Litterly is an iOS application made to gamify the trash pickup experience with the inspiration from #trashtag and the NYC Zero Waste initiative.
     My team and I are most proud to share that we were able to develop an MVP within just a couple of months, which awarded us the #1 best app by
     J.P. Morgan and Clearpool on CodePath's Demo Day. Even though we are still hard at work, we plan to launch with the goal in mind to change the world 
     and encourage users to clean up the world one piece of trash at a time. </p>
