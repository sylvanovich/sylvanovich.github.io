<h2>About me</h2>
  <p> I am a triplet living in Brooklyn, NY studying Computer Information Systems at Baruch College. In 2015 I chose to challenge myself
    and relocate to New York on my own. With this change at such an early age, I not only learned a lot about myself as an individual but
    I had the opportunity to follow my passion for photography. If I had known my passion for photography would land my first job 
    at an Apple retail store as a technician, I would have started earlier. While working in the Apple of World Trade Center, I quickly 
    found my interest for leading teams, solving complex technical problems as well as the technology industry. I chose to step out of my 
    comfort zone and experience other challenges, which encouraged me to apply to Google in 2017. With the achievement of passing the Google
    interviews, I knew that the technology industry was for me. After spending a 3 month internship in the Google NYC office, I was even more 
    hungry for challenging projects. With that being said, I took the initiative to get my hands dirty by joining multiple startups with their work. 
    To this day I have held a leadership role at Apple, two internships at Google and worked in a few self-starting startups to learn what it takes 
    to become the best person that I can be. </p>
